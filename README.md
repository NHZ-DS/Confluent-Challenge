# Confluent-Challenge
🏭 Industrial Air Quality Sentinel

Real-Time IoT Pipeline with Flink SQL & Local AI (Ollama)This project is a hybrid real-time industrial IoT pipeline designed to monitor air quality in factory environments. It captures raw sensor data, processes it via cloud-native streaming, and uses Local AI to generate immediate HSE (Health, Safety, and Environment) recommendations.


🚀 Project Infrastructure
Our infrastructure is built for scale and low-latency decision-making:
-Ingestion: A Python-based IoT simulator publishes raw CO_2 and PM_{2.5} data to Confluent Cloud.
-Stream Processing: Flink SQL transforms high-frequency raw data into stable 30-second averages to eliminate noise.
-Edge AI Inference:
